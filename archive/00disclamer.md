# Data at archive.luftdaten.info

## about

This archive contains CSV dumps of all outdoor sensors that seem to have delivered valid data to the API.
The data is organised in directories for each day, containing csv files for each sensor.
There may be multiple sensors in one measurement station (e.g. PM and temperature/humidity), their data will be in different files.
